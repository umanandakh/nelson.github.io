<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> In this chapter, we study the Laplace transformation, which is one of several important transforms
used in linear system analysis. The function of a transform tool is to convert operation of one type into
operations of different type. The Laplace transform offers significant advantages. Through this tool,
we model continuous time physical system with linear differential equations with constant coefficients.
The Laplace transform has no physical significance except that it transforms the time domain signal
to a complex frequency domain.</p>

<p>It is useful to simplify the mathematical comoputations and it can be used for the easy analysis
of signals and systems. We use the Laplace transform to solve differential equations, the solutions are
functions of the Laplace transformation variable ’s’ rather of the time variable ’t’. Therefore we must
have a method for converting from function ’s’ back to function of t, this procedure is called Inverse
Laplace transformation.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>If the Laplace transform of a function F(t) is f(s), i.e, LF(t) = f(s) then F(t) is called an Inverse
Laplace transformation of f(s).
We also write F(t) = L<sup>−1</sup>f(s) </p>

<p>L<sup>−1</sup> is called the Inverse Laplace transformation operator.
The Inverse Laplace Transform can be described as the transformation into a function of time. In the
Laplace inverse formula, F(s) is the Transform of F(t), while in Inverse Transform F(t) is the Inverse
Laplace Transform of F(s). Therefore, we can write this Inverse Laplace transform formula as follows:</p>

<p> If the integrable functions differ on the Lebesgue measure, then the integrable functions can have
the same Laplace transform. Therefore, there is an inverse transform on the very range of transform.
The inverse of a complex function F(s) to generate a real-valued function f(t) is an inverse Laplace
transformation of the function. If a unique function is continuous on 0 to ∞ limit and also has the
property of Laplace Transform. This function is, therefore an exponentially restricted real function.</p>
